# Bike-Rental-Service
Predictive modeling project for MA 575

Coding Language: R

Introduction
The success and availability of bike sharing services depends highly on the usage of such services. Bikes must be available when and 
where people need them; otherwise, the rental service will not be used to its full capacity, and the provider will not be able to offset 
operation and maintenance costs. By understanding customersâ€™ usage of the bike sharing service, the provider can optimize their profit by 
ensuring that bikes are available when needed, and thus provide a better service for consumers. 

Data
The data is provided on both daily and hourly time scales. The outcome of interest is the count of bikes rented - by registered users, casual users, 
and both. Additionally, information on the time of rental is provided, including the date, season, day of the week, whether or not the day is a holiday, 
and whether or not the day is a weekday. Information on weather includes temperature, humidity, windspeed, and general quality of weather.

Questions
Interesting questions raised by this data include:
-	How does weather affect rental counts? Do only some weather variables have an effect?
-	How does time of day affect rental counts? Are there more rentals during rush hour? If there is a relationship between rental count and time of day, 
does it hold on both weekdays and weekends?
-	If weather is related to rental counts? What about vice versa?
-	Are people more intend to ride bikes during holiday or not? Which holiday has most rentals? How does weather affect this?
-	Is there a difference in number of people using shared bikes between weekends and weekdays? Compare registered vs. casual.
-	Is there any relationship between the number of registered users and not registered users? Are registered users more likely to use the bike for multiple times?
-	Look into correlation between variables (collinearity)
-	Run regression with all variables separately - see which have higher p-values
-	Variable selection (automatic or manual)
